## Steps to test the application:

2) Go to your project directory and build the jar file from the command line `mvn clean install`, if your using maven plugin means.
3) Then to build the docker image use the below command,
    `docker build -t docker-spring-boot .`
3) Then you can list out the images to check the docker images has been build successfully or not,
   `docker image`
4) Not we need to run the docker images and need to link it to the mysql running images right, lets  do it by using below command,
  `docker run -p 7070:7070 -d docker-spring-boot`
5) To check the container is running or not use the command `docker ps` which will list out all the runing containers.  
5) Thats all now we can access the deployed application from the port 7070.
